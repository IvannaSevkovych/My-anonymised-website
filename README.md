# My website

This is the anonymised version of my website, [ivanna.sevkovych.com](https://ivanna.sevkovych.com). 

You can build and run the project as is: just run `npm install` and `npm start`. I will not maintain this repository, as this is only meant as a coding sample and maybe an example for anyone interested in how to use `Three.js`. Feel free to use any techniques from the code and do not hesitate to ask questions. I have left references to my social media accounts in the code. However be aware that the website as a whole is copyright protected.

One more time special thanks to [Yuri Artyukh](https://www.youtube.com/user/flintyara) for providing much of the inspiration for this project.
